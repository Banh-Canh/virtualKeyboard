# virtualKeyboard
A simple virtual keyboard using JS-only. 
The objective was to make it a bookmarklet but with the CSP, it doesn't seem to be worth it.

But with my sauce (since i'm learning, i'm trying to do it with what I understand for now) and some improvements (ex: write on cursor instead of the text area etc..).

I also tried to use it as a mozilla addon but it's having problems with a lots of site, not consistent enough.
