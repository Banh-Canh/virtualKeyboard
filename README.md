# virtualKeyboard
A simple virtual keyboard using JS-only. 
The objective was to make it a bookmarklet but with the CSP, it doesn't seem to be worth it.
         
I'm doing it at my sauce (since i'm learning, i'm trying to do it with what I understand for now).

I also tried to use it as a mozilla addon but it's having problems with a lots of site, not consistent enough.

It is possible to use it on your website, just add the script and call it in the html <script src=""></script>. It should initialize and detect all text areas. The keyboard will appear when a text area is in focus. You might have to change the file path for some icons.
